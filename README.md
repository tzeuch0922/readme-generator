## Description
A program written in node.js for producing a professional readme. It will take user input using inquirer to ask the user relevant questions to produce the readme. The only required information is the title and description, but the readme will be more detailed if the user answers more of the questions. The generator will check to make sure that the title and description are given and won't continue otherwise. The generator won't generate information or headers for contents not given.
